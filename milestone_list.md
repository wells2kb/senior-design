 * Finished Design - This is both a deliverable and a milestone. The deisgn must be presented and it also marks a change in foucs in the project.
 * Inital Implementation - The inital implementation should be quick and dirty to act as something that can be tested to drive further deisgn improvement.
 * Benchmarking - Using the inital implementation there should be a phase of consistent and relavent benchmarking to test for performance regression.
 * Final Implementation - The final milestone is completion where all code is acceptable in quality and performance.
