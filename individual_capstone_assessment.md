# Kaleb Wells Individual Capstone Assessment

## Project Perspective

For me this project is about creating some new that has real value.
This project is centered around Gaussian Splatting which is a game changing technology.
The technology is still in its' infancy which means the door is wide open for growth.
Through my colletive experience I have been able to find an interesting area of growth.
It is challanging to work with something so new, but I find that exciting.
I feel lucky to explore what is possible with this technology.

## Application of Collective College Experience

### College Curriculum 

My experiences at the University of Cincinnati will help guide the development.
The two classes that I expect to be the most helpful are Programing Languages (CS3003) and User Interface (CS5167).
Programming Languages is a fundemental course but it applies to every project, including this one.
Specifically, I will have to read the Unity specific shader lanugage spec to write it.
User Interface is particuraly relavant to this project due to each feature requiring a UI.
I have only meantioned these two classes but almost all my classes should be of some help.

### Co-Op Experiences

My co-op experiences have helped me select this project and given me the skills to work on it.
One rotation at MSA Safety I was on a Devops team where I got to experience designing new features for developers.
That experience is exactally what I will be doing in this project.
My previous and last rotation was at Kinetic Vision where I got to work on Gaussian Splatting.
During my work with the technology I found that what I wanted did not exist.
Now I can build exactally what I think should exist using my experience.

## Motivation and Approach

### Motivation

Personally I find Gaussian Splatting to be stunning and there are many things I like about working with it.
I think it is amazing that we can capture reality in 3D.
I've created some interactive applications using the technology and they were all mind blowing.
I want to enhance what people can build so we all can share new experiences.
Working with this technology applies almost everything I know in a statisfying way.
Gaining more experience with this technology will also help me be able to work more in the space.

### Approach

Using my experience my approach will be to spend a lot of time ironing out the design.
I have always found on co-op that spending more effort on design was well worth the effort.
I plan to create many sketches of different UIs and diagrams for code.
So, part of my vision of success is a clear well thought out design.
If I can create an extensible/modular design and implment around three new features I will be satisfied.
I will only be disapointed if I don't learn something new.
