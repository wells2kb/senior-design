## Visual Fidelity

The true value of Gaussian Splatting lies in its' visual fidelity.
Degrading the visuals of this approach would be making something that has no use.
Introducing real time artifacts might also make someone in VR extremely motion sick.
As much as this is a constraint is also an opprunity to for improvement within the bounds of other contraints.

## Hardware

Gaussian Splatting rendering is currently very inefficient compared to tradional mesh rendering.
There are many milions of Gaussians in each Gaussian splat scene which drasticly multiplies any inefficences. 
Increasing performance would widen the horizion of Gaussian Splatting in constrained domains like mobile or desktop VR.
Any solution that lower efficiency is likely not a real solution.

## Time

The solutions I come up with have to be possible to implement before this project is due.
I am also only one person with many other things going on in my life other than this project.
